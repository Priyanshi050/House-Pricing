🏡 Housing Price Prediction - Machine Learning Project
This project focuses on predicting house prices using supervised machine learning techniques based on housing attributes.

📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains various features related to residential homes, such as:

LotArea – Lot size in square feet

OverallQual – Overall material and finish quality

YearBuilt – Original construction date

GrLivArea – Above grade (ground) living area

GarageCars – Number of cars in garage

Neighborhood – Physical location within the city

SalePrice – Target variable (price of the house)

🎯 Objective
Build a regression model to accurately predict house prices based on key features.
